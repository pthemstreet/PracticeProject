This is my first project using HTML, CSS, and PHP to create a basic login page.
This is actually my first project using HTML and CSS ...  I also haven't used this much PHP ever, so be gentle.

Features:
-pretty decent CSS
-database connection
-working signup and login
-simple error handling

I use WAMP to run phpmyadmin and locally host the "website" as I do not have access to a web hosting yet (personal website + webhosting in progress).

To open the website properly I put these files in /wamp64/www in whatever directory WAMP is installed. Next, start WAMP, allow it to complete startup, then navigate to http://localhost/htdocs/PracticeProject/index.php. ***IF WAMP HAS NOT FINISHED STARTUP, YOU MAY ENCOUNTER ERRORS***
